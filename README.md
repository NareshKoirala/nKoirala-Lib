## Firmware Library



**Student Libraries** - Naresh Prasad Koirala

This is my final code for the firmware of the micro-board provided to us (MC9S12XDP512).

The structure template code as a `.h` file was provided by the instructor, but the overall functionality in the `.c` file was coded and developed by me (Naresh P. Koirala) under the supervision of the instructor, with reference to the datasheet and well-defined register information from the datasheet.

Initially, I coded `sw_led` for the first time. The final library includes `ect`, `adc`, `pwm`, and `i2c`.
